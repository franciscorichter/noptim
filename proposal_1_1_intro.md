## 1.1. Introduction

This project explores the potential of using trained Neural Networks (NNs) as surrogate optimizers for high-dimensional Linear Programming (LP) problems. Traditional LP solvers, while exact, can be computationally intensive for very large-scale problems. Inspired by the concepts of statistical learning and stochastic programs discussed in the provided reference material (Week13.pdf), this project investigates whether NNs can learn the mapping from LP problem parameters (objective function coefficients, constraint matrix, constraint bounds) to optimal solutions. The core idea is to generate a dataset of diverse LP instances and their corresponding optimal solutions obtained via a standard solver. This dataset will then be used to train NNs. The project aims to define a series of experiments, increasing in complexity, to evaluate the feasibility, accuracy, and generalization capabilities of this NN-based approach. The ultimate goal is to provide a detailed project definition, including methodology, mathematical formulation, experiment code, and a webpage summarizing the findings, serving as a foundation for further research and development in this area.
