## 1.5. Deliverables

The primary deliverables for this defined project phase will be:

1.  **Project Proposal Document:** A comprehensive document (this document, compiled) detailing the project's introduction, problem definition, methodology, and experiment outline.
2.  **Mathematical Documentation:** A LaTeX file (`math_docs.tex`) containing the formal mathematical definitions for:
    *   The standard form Linear Programming problem.
    *   A conceptual description of the proposed Neural Network architecture (input/output layers, activation functions).
    *   The primary loss function (e.g., MSE between predicted and true solutions).
3.  **Python Experiment Code:** A Python script (`lp_nn_experiments.py`) containing functions for:
    *   Generating feasible and bounded high-dimensional LP instances (`generate_lp`).
    *   Solving LP instances using a standard solver (`solve_lp`).
    *   Defining the NN model architecture using TensorFlow/Keras (`build_nn_model`).
    *   Training the NN model (`train_nn`).
    *   Evaluating the trained NN model (`evaluate_nn`).
    *   A basic structure to run the outlined experiments (Note: The code will be provided but not executed by the AI agent).
4.  **Static Webpage:** An HTML file (`index.html`) with associated CSS (`style.css`) presenting the project information. This webpage will include:
    *   Sections mirroring the project proposal (Introduction, Problem, Methodology, Experiments).
    *   An overview or link to the mathematical formulations.
    *   Code snippets or a link to the full Python script.
    *   A clear presentation of the project's goals and approach.

These deliverables collectively define the project scope, methodology, and provide the necessary tools (code) to begin the experimental phase.
