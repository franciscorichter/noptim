## 1.6. Additional Problem: Polynomial Optimization

As a second benchmark, this project will also investigate the use of NNs for optimizing polynomial functions. This involves finding the minimum (or maximum) value of a given polynomial function, potentially subject to constraints (though we will start with unconstrained optimization).

**Problem Definition:**
Find $\mathbf{x}^*$ such that $P(\mathbf{x}^*)$ is minimized (or maximized), where $P(\mathbf{x})$ is a polynomial function of variables $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_d)$.

Example (2D): Minimize $P(x_1, x_2) = (x_1 - 2)^2 + (x_2 + 1)^2 + 0.5 x_1 x_2$

**Methodology:**
1.  **Polynomial Generation:** Define a way to generate polynomial functions of varying degrees and number of variables (e.g., by generating coefficients). Start with simple, low-degree polynomials in few variables.
2.  **Data Generation:** Generate training data. This could involve:
    *   Sampling points $\mathbf{x}$ in a domain and evaluating $P(\mathbf{x})$. The NN could learn the function landscape.
    *   Alternatively, for a set of generated polynomials, find their true optima $\mathbf{x}^*$ (analytically or numerically). The NN input would represent the polynomial (e.g., its coefficients), and the output would be the predicted optimum $\mathbf{x}^*_{pred}$. This aligns more closely with the LP approach.
    *   Monte Carlo methods can be used for sampling the domain or potentially for evaluating complex polynomials or finding approximate optima for training data generation.
3.  **NN Architecture:** An MLP similar to the one used for LP can be employed. The input would represent the polynomial (e.g., coefficients), and the output would be the predicted location of the optimum $\mathbf{x}^*_{pred}$.
4.  **Training:** Train the NN using a suitable loss function, such as the MSE between the predicted optimum $\mathbf{x}^*_{pred}$ and the true optimum $\mathbf{x}^*$, or potentially a loss based on the polynomial value at the predicted optimum $P(\mathbf{x}^*_{pred})$.
5.  **Evaluation:** Evaluate the NN's ability to find optima for unseen polynomials. Metrics include the distance between predicted and true optima ($||\mathbf{x}^* - \mathbf{x}^*_{pred}||$) and the difference in the objective function values ($|P(\mathbf{x}^*) - P(\mathbf{x}^*_{pred})|$).

**Experiment Outline (Polynomials):**
1.  **Simple Polynomials:** Start with low-degree (e.g., quadratic) polynomials in 1 or 2 variables.
2.  **Increasing Degree/Variables:** Gradually increase the polynomial degree and the number of variables.
3.  **Complex Landscapes:** Test polynomials known to have multiple local minima/maxima.
4.  **Visualization:** Use plots (e.g., contour plots for 2D) to visualize the polynomial landscape, the true optimum, and the NN's predicted optimum, demonstrating the NN's learning capability.
